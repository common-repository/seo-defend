Ongoing protection and monitoring of your Wordpress website and domain against negative SEO, black hat SEO techniques and bad SEOs.

== Description ==

WordPress automatically solves many SEO related issues. However, WordPress can't take care of ensuring your website and domain assets are protected against [negative SEO](https://seodefend.com/negative-seo), black hat SEO techniques and bad SEOs. [SEO Defend](https://seodefend.com) is a SaaS SEO monitoring solution, based on WordPress which ensures your Wordpress site is always protected.

We periodcially scan and monitor your website with respect to domain, content, link, algorithm and social media related risk factors, look at SEO Defend as insurance for your SEO. Avoid Google penalties and keep your WordPress website safe from search engine algorithm updates. We'll also assist with [Google penalty recovery](https://seodefend.com/google-penalty-recovery).

Our SEO Defend plugin presents a risk analysis score of the current SEO state of your WordPress website. It does this simply by adding a graphical summary to your existing WordPress dashboard.

The SEO risk analysis score is divided into five (5) key risk factor areas:

* Domain factors: Registrar security, WHOIS protection, DNS risk, DDOS protection, IP block / distribution factors, domain name related factors
* Content factors: Duplicate content detection, content theft, content quality, general content related factors
* Link factors: Backlink quality, backlink amount, backlink velocity, anchor text risk factors, backlink detox alerts
* Algorithmic factors: Google algorithm changes, Google penalty protection, penalty risk alerts, upcoming algorithmic changes
* Social factors (coming soon...): Social media spam, social account standing, social impersonation, social privacy concerns

This plugin uses the external SEO Defend API service to calculate your SEO risk analysis score. The service scans your default WordPress domain (home_url) to calculate and return your SEO risk analysis score. The SEO risk analysis score is returned in JSON format and displayed in the SEO Protection Dashboard widget after a bit of scan processing time.

If the last risk analysis score calculation was performed over thirty (30) days ago a new calculation will be initiated by the external API server. Continuous and real-time enterprise monitoring solutions are available with more information found on our the [SEO Defend pricing](https://seodefend.com/pricing) section of our website.

The [SEO Defend API](https://seodefend.com/api) connection used was specially created for private WordPress use and is not intended for other types of usage outside of the WordPress administration, whether commercial or private use. You can request API access via our [contact us](https://seodefend.com/contact) form.
